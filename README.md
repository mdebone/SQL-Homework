# SQL-Homework
REAMDE 

Did the prework, created the repository and cloned it into my local, created the EmployeeSQL folder locally and added 6 csv’s and pushed to Github. I didn’t like the ERD that was linked with these instructions, and so after working with that for a while I decided it was more fruitful to at least get the data into pgAdmin.
